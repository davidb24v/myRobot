Arduino sketch to control an autonomous robot with a few sensors on board.

 - HMC6352 Compass
 - SR HC-04 Ultrasonic Sensor
 - DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor
 - 2 x TB6612FNG motor drivers
 - MCP23017 I/O Extender
 
It's using a DFRobot Pirate 4WD Mobile Platform, wasn't sure if I could
run this off a single TB6612FNG so I went ahead and used 2 anyway. That's
why there's a MCP23017 in the mix too.
