Arduino sketch to control an autonomous robot with a few sensors on board.


Robot rebuilt and software needs re-writing. This file is out of date but 
will be fixed real soon now. Just needed to get the source rebuilt and 
uploaded first...


 - SR HC-04 Ultrasonic Sensor
 
It's using a DFRobot Pirate 4WD Mobile Platform, wasn't sure if I could
run this off a single TB6612FNG so I went ahead and used 2 anyway. That's
why there's a MCP23017 in the mix too.

Requires:

1) Tim Eckel's NewPing Library
